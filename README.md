The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
The most suitable system to install ROS is Linux. I choose to work with Ubuntu 18.04.6.
Instead of lunch the system on the device directly, I use virtual machine to install the Ubuntu on.
VMware workstation 17 Pro is the program I use.
After installing the Ubuntu on VM, we can start workin on the system directly.

After that we install the ROS inside the Ubuntu.
For Ubuntu 18.04.6, we will work with ROS melodic.
Then,I create Catkin workstation to save our work in.
Finally, I install the the package arduino_robot_arm
using the order below i was able to start the simulation of robot arm.
roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors.launch
The attached video shows how I move the joints of the robot arm in all directions.
